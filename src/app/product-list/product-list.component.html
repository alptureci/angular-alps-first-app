<h2>Products</h2>

<!--*ngFor is a "structural directive". Structural directives shape or reshape the DOM's structure, typically by adding, removing, and manipulating the elements to which they are attached. Directives with an asterisk, *, are structural directives.-->
<div class="product" *ngFor="let product of products; index as productId">

  <!--To display the names of the products, use the interpolation syntax {{ }}. Interpolation renders a property's value as text. Inside the <div>, add an <h3> to display the interpolation of the product's name property:-->
  <h3>

    <!--Interpolation {{ }} lets you render the property value as text; property binding [ ] lets you use the property value in a template expression.-->
    <a [title]="product.name + ' details'" [routerLink]="['/products', productId]">
    {{product.name}}
    </a>
  </h3>

  <!--Add the product descriptions. On the <p> element, use an *ngIf directive so that Angular only creates the <p> element if the current product has a description.-->
  <p *ngIf="product.description">
    Description: {{ product.description }}
  </p>
  <p *ngIf="product.price">
    Price: ${{product.price}}
  </p>

  <!--Be AWARE of () parantheses, without them it doesn't emit events!!!-->
  <button (click)="share()">
    Share
  </button>

  <!--To include the new component, use its selector, app-product-alerts, as you would an HTML element.-->
  <!--Pass the current product as input to the component using property binding.-->
  <app-product-alerts
  [product]="product"
  (notify)="onNotify()">
</app-product-alerts>


</div>
