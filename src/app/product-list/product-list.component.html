<h2>Products</h2>

<!--*ngFor is a "structural directive". Structural directives shape or reshape the DOM's structure, typically by adding, removing, and manipulating the elements to which they are attached. Directives with an asterisk, *, are structural directives.-->
<div *ngFor="let product of products">

  <!--To display the names of the products, use the interpolation syntax {{ }}. Interpolation renders a property's value as text. Inside the <div>, add an <h3> to display the interpolation of the product's name property:-->
  <h3>

    <!--Interpolation {{ }} lets you render the property value as text; property binding [ ] lets you use the property value in a template expression.-->
    <a [title]="product.name + ' details'">
    {{product.name}}
    </a>
  </h3>

  <!--Add the product descriptions. On the <p> element, use an *ngIf directive so that Angular only creates the <p> element if the current product has a description.-->
  <p *ngIf="product.description">
    Description: {{ product.description }}
  </p>

  <button click="share()">
    Share
